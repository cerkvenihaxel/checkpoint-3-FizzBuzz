# FizzBuzz Program in Swift

This is a simple FizzBuzz program written in Swift. The program takes an input number (x) from the user and applies the FizzBuzz rules to determine the result.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `main.swift` file to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Swift installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where `main.swift` is located.
4. Compile the code using the following command:

swiftc main.swift

5. After compiling, run the program:

6. The program will prompt you to enter a number (x).
7. Enter a number and press enter to see the FizzBuzz result.

## FizzBuzz Rules

- If the input number is divisible by 3, the program will print "Fizz".
- If the input number is divisible by 5, the program will print "Buzz".
- If the input number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the program will print "FizzBuzz".
- For all other numbers, the program will print the number itself.

## Example

Enter a number (x) : 15
Result : FizzBuzz

Enter a number (x) : 9
Result : Fizz

Enter a number (x) : 10
Result : Buzz

Enter a number (x) : 7
Result : 7


## Exit the Program

To exit the program, enter the number 99 when prompted for input.
